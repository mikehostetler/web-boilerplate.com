_ansi_up_ is a simple library for converting text embedded with ANSI terminal color commands into HTML spans that render the proper coloring. This is compliant with AMD (require.js). This code has been used in production since early 2012. This is a new project, but I will actively maintain it and welcome all feedback. Thanks for reading.

## Browser Example

    <script src="ansi_up.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">

    var txt  = "\n\n\033[1;33;40m 33;40  \033[1;33;41m 33;41  \033[1;33;42m 33;42  \033[1;33;43m 33;43  \033[1;33;44m 33;44  \033[1;33;45m 33;45  \033[1;33;46m 33;46  \033[1m\033[0\n\n\033[1;33;42m >> Tests OK\n\n"

    var html = ansi_up.ansi_to_html(txt);

    var cdiv = document.getElementById("console");

    cdiv.innerHTML = html;

    </script>

## Node Example

    var ansi_up = require('ansi_up');

    var txt  = "\n\n\033[1;33;40m 33;40  \033[1;33;41m 33;41  \033[1;33;42m 33;42  \033[1;33;43m 33;43  \033[1;33;44m 33;44  \033[1;33;45m 33;45  \033[1;33;46m 33;46  \033[1m\033[0\n\n\033[1;33;42m >> Tests OK\n\n"

    var html = ansi_up.ansi_to_html(txt);


There are examples in the repo that demonstrate an AMD/require.js/ jQuery example as well as a simple browser example.

## Installation

    $ npm install ansi_up

## API

_ansi_up_ should be called via the functions defined on the module. It is recommended that the HTML is rendered with a monospace font and black background. See the examples, for a basic CSS definition.

#### escape_for_html (txt)

This does the minimum escaping of text to make it compliant with HTML. In particular, the '&','<', and '>' characters are escaped.

#### linkify (txt)

This replaces any links in the text with anchor tags that display the link. The links should have at least one whitespace character surrounding it.

#### ansi_to_html (txt)

This replaces ANSI terminal escape codes with SPAN tags that wrap the content. The styles are inline on the SPAN tags.
## Building

Currently we are not using a build system, so there is just one file. Feel free to include the file in your asset minification process.

## Running tests

To run the tests for _ansi_up_, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then:

    $ make test
